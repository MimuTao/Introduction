% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are

% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
Most of existing results do not take the effects of backlash hysteresis of actuators into account in controller design of missile systems, but such hysteresis seems inevitable in practice. In this paper, a robust adaptive neural network control law for missile system with unknown parameters and hysteresis input is proposed based on backstepping technique. The controller is designed by introducing neural network approximation which can be adjusted by an adaptive law based on backstepping approach. The developed neural network controller does not require a priori knowledge of the unknown backlash hysteresis. In particular, unlike existing results on adaptive compensation for unknown backlash hysteresis, the $sign$ of $b$ is no longer needed. It is shown that the designed controller can ensure the stability and tracking performance of the closed-loop system.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
%
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
%
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
%
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
%
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.

\IEEEPARstart{T}{ime} delay exists in wide range of practical systems, especially in mechanics, physics, biology and engineering systems and so on. Because the effect of time delays may lead to instability or even catastrophic accidents, so it cannot be ignored in the design and analysis of control systems. In the context of time delay systems, several schemes have been proposed in recent twenty years, see for example \cite{n1}-\cite{n7}. For neural network systems including coupled neural networks \cite{n1}, uncertain neural systems \cite{n2}, Markovian jump neural networks \cite{n3}, discrete-time neural networks \cite{n4}-\cite{n5}, several results have been achieved to compensate the effect of time delays. For uncertain nonlinear systems, especially parametric strict feedback systems, the existence of unknown time delay make the controller design and stability analysis become difficult. The triangular time delay term is considered in \cite{n6}-\cite{n7} and the control laws have been proposed by using backstepping technology.

On the other hand, some common phenomena such as actuator failures \cite{n8}-\cite{n10}, fading \cite{n11}, uncertain kinematics and dynamics to robotic systems \cite{n12} and electronic circuits systems \cite{n13}, dead-zone \cite{n14}-\cite{n17}, input and sensor nonlinearities \cite{n18}-\cite{n20}, backlash \cite{n21}, state constraint \cite{n22} of practical systems have great effect on the performance of the controlled system. Actuator failures are inevitable in all practical systems and often uncertain in time, value and pattern. Therefore, the uncertainties caused by unknown failures are difficult to compensate. Especially, the existence of time delays renders such problem much more complex. In this paper, we address such a problem by considering controlling a second-order nonlinear time delay systems. 

The main contributions of this paper, compared with the existing results, are as follows: (1) The control problem is investigated for missile system with unknown parameters and unknown hysteresis input. (2) In addition, by constructing neural networks to approximate the unknown backlash hysteresis, the developed neural network controller requires no priori knowledge on the unknown backlash hysteresis. (3) Moreover, unlike existing results about adaptive compensation for unknown backlash hysteresis, the $sign$ of $b$ is no longer needed in the design of the control law. It is shown that the proposed adaptive neural network controller can ensure the boundedness of all the signals of the closed loop missile system and the desired tracking performance is also guaranteed.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we formulate the missile system by differential equations and  give the neural network pre-compensator for backlash nonlinearity. Adaptive control scheme and stability analyses of the closed-loop system are given in section 3. In section 4, we use a practical system to present the effectiveness of our control scheme. Finally, the paper is concluded in section 5.

\section{Models and problem statement}
For illustrating our design ideas, the following class of second-order nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters and unknown time delay is considered. The system model is given as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq1}
 &&\dot{x}_1=x_2+h_1(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))\nonumber\\
 &&\dot{x}_2=\theta^Tf(x)+\sum\limits_{i=1}^mb_iu_i+h_2(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))\nonumber\\
 &&y=x_1
\end{eqnarray}
where $x=(x_1,x_2)^T$ is system state and $u_i\in R$ $(i=1, 2\cdots, m)$ is input, $y=x_1$ is output. $f(x)\in R^p$ is known function and $b_i\in R$ $(i=1, 2\cdots, m)$, $\theta\in R^p$ are unknown parameters. $h_1(\cdot)$, $h_2(\cdot) \in R$ are known smooth functions and $\tau\in R$ is unknown time delay of state $x$.

We now consider the $i$th actuator may fail during its operation. As in \cite{n8} and \cite{n9}, the failure of the $i$th actuator at time instant $t_{if}$ can be modelled as follows
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq2}
 &&u_i=\rho_iu_{ci}+u_{ki},~~(\forall t\geq t_{if})\nonumber\\
 &&\rho_iu_{ki}=0
\end{eqnarray}
where $u_{ci}$ is the input of the $i$th actuator and $\rho_i\in [0, 1]$, $u_{ki}$ and $t_{if}$ are unknown constant. The following three cases are discussed in detail
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\rho_i=1$,\\
  It indicates $u_i=u_{ci}$. The $i$th actuator works normally.
  \item $0<\rho_i<1$,\\
  It indicates $u_i=\rho_iu_{ci}$. The $i$th actuator is called partial loss of effectiveness.
  \item $\rho_i=0$,\\
  It indicates $u_i=u_{ki}$. The $i$th actuator is called total loss of effectiveness.
\end{itemize}
The control objective is to design adaptive control scheme for the system (\ref{eq1}) with unknown actuator failures given in (\ref{eq2}) to guarantee all signals bounded. To design adaptive control scheme, the following Assumptions for system functions, unknown time delay and actuator failures are made.

\textbf{Assumption 1:} Nonlinear functions $h_i(x_1, x_2)~~i=1, 2$ such that
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq3}
|h_i(x_1, x_2)|\leq \delta_i||(x_1, x_2)||_2~~(i=1, 2)
\end{eqnarray}
where $\delta_i>0$ is a known constant.

\textbf{Remark 1:} In the context of adaptive control of strict-feedback systems with state delays by using backstepping techniques, the time delay term in the $i$th state differential equation is required to only depend on states $x_1, \cdots, x_i$, for examples \cite{n6} and \cite{n7}. Such a requirement can keep the control system has triangular structure which is needed by backstepping. However according to Assumption 1, the bounding function of time delay term $h_i(x_1, x_2)$ in system (\ref{eq1}) can depend all system states. Thus it means that such triangular structure requirement is no longer needed in this paper.

\textbf{Remark 2:} $\delta_i$ can be interpreted as the gain or strength of the time delay term. In this paper, we will discuss how to obtain the adaptive controller of system (\ref{eq1}). The existence of time delay and unknown actuator failures given in (\ref{eq2}) render the controller design much more complex and difficult, therefore the result given in this paper will be aimed at enough small $\delta_i$. It makes our results limited.

\textbf{Assumption 2:} The number of total fail actuators is up to $m-1$ and the control objectives can be achieved by other normal actuators. Also any actuator can change only from normal to partial failure or total failure once.

\textbf{Remark 3:} Assumption 2 is a basic assumption required in adaptive failure compensation. It can be concluded that total number of actuator failures is finite and there exists a finite time instant $T_f$ after which no new failure will occur.

\textbf{Assumption 3:} Unknown parameter $b_i\neq 0$ and the sign of $b_i$ is known.

With actuator failure model given in (\ref{eq2}), system (\ref{eq1}) can be rewritten as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq4}
\dot{x}_1&=&x_2+h_1(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))\nonumber\\
\dot{x}_2&=&\theta^T f(x)+\sum\limits_{i=1}^mb_i(\rho_iu_{ci}+u_{ki})\nonumber\\
          &&+h_2(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))\\
y&=&x_1\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Design and analysis of adaptive controllers}
To obtain suitable control law and update laws based on the backstepping approach, the following change of coordinates are introduced.
\begin{equation}\label{eq5}
\begin{array}{l}
  z_1=y=x_1 \\
  z_2=x_2-\alpha_{1}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{1}$ is the virtual control in step 1. Below we will give the design details following the recursive backstepping procedure.

Step 1: From (\ref{eq1}) and (\ref{eq5}) the derivative of $z_1$ can be rewritten as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq6}
\dot z_1&=&\dot x_1\nonumber\\
        &=&x_2+h_1(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))\nonumber\\
        &=&z_2+\alpha_{1}+h_1(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))
\end{eqnarray}
We define a positive definite Lyapunov function as follows
\begin{equation}\label{eq7}
\bar V_1=\frac{1}{2}z_1^2+\frac{e_1}{2}\int_{t-\tau}^tU_1(x_1(s), x_2(s))ds
\end{equation}
where $e_1>0$ is a design parameter. Smooth function $U_1(x_1(s), x_2(s))$ is chosen as
\begin{equation}\label{eq8}
U_1(x_1(s), x_2(s))=h_1^2(x_1(s), x_2(s))
\end{equation}
Then we can get the derivative of $\bar V_1$ is
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq9}
\dot {\bar V}_1&=&z_1\dot z_1+\frac{e_1}{2}U_1(x_1(s), x_2(s))\Big|_{t-\tau}^t\nonumber\\
        &=&z_1(z_2+\alpha_{1}+h_1(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau)))\\
        &&+\frac{e_1}{2}(h_1^2(x_1(t), x_2(t))-h_1^2(x_1(t-\tau), x_2(t-\tau)))\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Note that
\begin{equation}\label{eq10}
z_1h_1(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))\leq\frac{z_1^2}{2 e_1}+\frac{e_1}{2}h_1^2(x_1(t-\tau), x_2(t-\tau))
\end{equation}
So we have
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq11}
\dot {\bar V}_1\leq z_1(z_2+\alpha_{1})+\frac{z_1^2}{2 e_1}+\frac{e_1}{2}h_1^2(x_1(t), x_2(t))
\end{eqnarray}
Virtual control $a_1$ can be chosen as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq12}
\alpha_1=-k_1z_1-\frac{1}{2 e_1}z_1
\end{eqnarray}
where $k_1$ is a positive design parameter.
Then from (\ref{eq11}) and (\ref{eq12}) we have
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq13}
\dot {\bar V}_1&\leq& z_1(z_2-k_1z_1-\frac{1}{2 e_1}z_1)+\frac{z_1^2}{2 e_1}+\frac{e_1}{2}h_1^2(x_1(t), x_2(t))\nonumber\\
               &=&z_1z_2-k_1z_1^2+\frac{e_1}{2}h_1^2(x_1(t), x_2(t))
\end{eqnarray}

Step 2: From (\ref{eq1}) and (\ref{eq5}), we have
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq14}
\dot z_2&=&\dot x_2-\dot\alpha_{1}\\
        &=&\theta^Tf(x)+\sum\limits_{i=1}^mb_iu_i+h_2(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))-\dot\alpha_{1}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Note that
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq15}
\dot\alpha_{1}&=&\frac{d\alpha_{1}}{dx_1}\dot x_1\\
&=&-(k_1+\frac{1}{2 e_1})(x_2+h_1(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau)))\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
We have
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq16}
\dot z_2&=&\theta^Tf(x)+\sum\limits_{i=1}^mb_iu_i+h_2(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))\nonumber\\
&&+(k_1+\frac{1}{2 e_1})(x_2+h_1(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau)))
\end{eqnarray}
From (\ref{eq1}) and (\ref{eq5}), we have
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq17}
z_2\dot z_2&=&z_2(\theta^Tf(x)+\sum\limits_{i=1}^mb_iu_i)\nonumber\\
&&+z_2h_2(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))\\
&&+(k_1+\frac{1}{2 e_1})z_2(x_2+h_1(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau)))\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Note that
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq18}
&&z_2h_2(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))\nonumber\\
&&\leq \frac{z_2^2}{2 e_{22}}+ \frac{e_{22}}{2}h_2^2(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))\nonumber\\
&&z_2h_1(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))\nonumber\\
&&\leq \frac{z_2^2}{2 e_{21}}+ \frac{e_{21}}{2}h_1^2(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))
\end{eqnarray}
where $e_{21}$ and $e_{22}$ are positive design parameters. Then we have
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq19}
z_2\dot z_2&\leq&z_2(\theta^Tf(x)+\sum\limits_{i=1}^mb_iu_i)+\frac{z_2^2}{2 e_{22}}+\frac{z_2^2}{2 e_{21}}\nonumber\\
&&+(k_1+\frac{1}{2 e_1})z_2x_2+\frac{e_{22}}{2}h_2^2(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))\nonumber\\
&&+\frac{e_{21}}{2}h_1^2(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))
\end{eqnarray}
Different from the standard backstepping approach, a virtual control $\alpha$ in this step is designed as follows
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq20}
\alpha&=&-z_1-k_2z_2-\hat\theta^Tf(x)-(k_1+\frac{1}{2 e_1})(\frac{1}{2 e_{21}}z_2+x_2)\nonumber\\
&&-\frac{1}{2 e_{22}}z_2
\end{eqnarray}
where $k_2$ is a positive design parameter and $\hat\theta$ is the estimation of $\theta$. Similar to \cite{r1} and \cite{r2}, the control law and update laws are designed as follows

\textbf{Control Law:}
\begin{equation}\label{eq21}
u_{ci}=sign(b_i)\hat{\varrho}^T\gamma
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\varrho}$ is the estimation of $\varrho$. $\varrho$ is an unknown parameter and $\gamma$ is a known function. Both are $m+1$ dimensional vectors and can be denoted as
\begin{equation}\label{eq22}
\varrho=(\varrho_1,\varrho_{21},\ldots,\varrho_{2m})^T, \gamma=(\gamma_1,\gamma_{21},\ldots,\gamma_{2m})^T
\end{equation}

\textbf{Update Laws:}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq23}
&&\dot{\hat\theta}=\Gamma_\theta f(x)z_2\nonumber\\
&&\dot{\hat\varrho}=-\Gamma_\varrho\gamma z_2
\end{eqnarray}
%\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq23}
%&&\dot{\hat\theta}=\Gamma_\theta(f(x)z_2+l_\theta(\hat\theta-\theta_0))\nonumber\\
%&&\dot{\hat\varrho}=-\Gamma_\varrho(\gamma z_2+l_\varrho(\hat\varrho-\varrho_0))
%\end{eqnarray}
where $\Gamma_\theta, \Gamma_\varrho$ are positive definite matrices.
%where $\Gamma_\theta, \Gamma_\varrho$ are positive definite matrices and $l_\theta, l_\varrho, \theta_0, \varrho_0$ are positive design parameters.

\section{Stability analysis}
We now analyze the stability of closed loop system with control law and update laws in (\ref{eq21}) and (\ref{eq23}). We use $T_j$ to represent the time instant at which the actuator failure occurred. Therefore, all actuators working condition do not change between two adjacent time point $T_i$ and $T_{i+1}$. Namely, no new normal actuator fails in time interval $(T_i, T_{i+1})$. Let the set $U_{iT}$ denotes the actuators of total failure in interval $(T_i, T_{i+1})$. Clearly, with Assumption 2 there exists a time instant $T_f$  such that no new failure will occur after it. Let $T_0=0$, $T_{f+1}=\infty$, so we can get $U_{0T}=\{1, 2,\cdots, m\}$ and $U_{fT}$ is not empty. Our mail result is given as follows

\textbf{Theorem 1:} Consider the time delay system (\ref{eq1}) with unknown actuator failures described by (\ref{eq2}) with control law (\ref{eq21}) and the update laws (\ref{eq23}). Under Assumption 1 to Assumption 3, there exist a positive constant $\delta^*$ such
that for all $\delta_i<\delta^*$ All the signals in the closed-loop system are globally
bounded. Also output $y$ satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{eq24}
lim_{t\rightarrow{\infty}}|y|=0
\end{equation}
\textbf{Proof.} Firstly, we consider the following Lyapunov function in time interval  $[T_i, T_{i+1})$
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq25}
V_i&=&\bar V_1+\frac{1}{2}z_2^2+\frac{1}{2}\tilde\theta^T\Gamma_\theta^{-1}\tilde\theta+\sum\limits_{i\in \bar U_{it}}\frac{\rho_i|b_i|}{2}\tilde{\varrho}^T\Gamma_{\varrho}^{-1}\tilde{\varrho}\nonumber\\
&&+\frac{e_{21}}{2}(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1})\int_{t-\tau}^tU_{21}(x_1(s), x_2(s))ds\nonumber\\
&&+\frac{e_{22}}{2}\int_{t-\tau}^tU_{22}(x_1(s), x_2(s))ds
\end{eqnarray}
where $\tilde{\varrho}=\hat\varrho-\varrho$ and $\tilde\theta=\hat\theta-\theta$ are estimation errors of $\varrho$ and $\theta$. Let $U_{21}(x_1(s), x_2(s))=h_1^2(x_1(s), x_2(s))$ and $U_{22}(x_1(s), x_2(s))=h_2^2(x_1(s), x_2(s))$. Then the derivative of $V_i$ is
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq26}
\dot V_i&=&\dot{\bar V}_1+z_2\dot z_2+\tilde\theta^T\Gamma_\theta^{-1}\dot{\hat\theta}+\sum\limits_{i\in \bar U_{it}}\rho_i|b_i|\tilde{\varrho}^T\Gamma_{\varrho}^{-1}\dot{\hat{\varrho}}\nonumber\\
&&+\frac{e_{21}}{2}(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1})(h_1^2(t)-h_1^2(t-\tau))\nonumber\\
&&+\frac{e_{22}}{2}(h_2^2(t)-h_2^2(t-\tau))
\end{eqnarray}
where we will use $h_i^2(t)$ and $h_i^2(t-\tau)$ represent $h_i^2(x_1(t),x_2(t))$ and $h_i^2(x_1(t-\tau),x_2(t-\tau))$, respectively. With (\ref{eq13}) and (\ref{eq19}) we have
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq27}
\dot V_i&\leq&z_1z_2-k_1z_1^2+\frac{e_1}{2}h_2^2(t)+z_2(\sum\limits_{i=1}^m(b_i\rho_iu_{ci}+u_{ki})\nonumber\\
&&+\theta^Tf(x)+(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1})x_2)+\frac{z_2^2}{2 e_{22}}+(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1})\nonumber\\
&&\frac{z_2^2}{2 e_{21}}+\tilde\theta^T\Gamma_\theta^{-1}\dot{\hat\theta}+\sum\limits_{i\in \bar U_{it}}\rho_i|b_i|\tilde{\varrho}^T\Gamma_{\varrho}^{-1}\dot{\hat{\varrho}}\nonumber\\
&&+\frac{e_{21}}{2}(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1})h_1^2(t)+\frac{e_{22}}{2}h_2^2(t)
\end{eqnarray}
We take $\varrho$ is
\begin{equation}\label{eq28}
\begin{array}{l}
\varrho_1=\frac{1}{\sum\limits_{i\in{\bar{U}_{iT}}}\rho_i|b_i|}\\
\varrho_{2i}=0,(i\in{\bar{U}_{iT}})\\
\varrho_{2i}=-\frac{b_iu_{ki}}{\sum\limits_{i\in{\bar{U}_{iT}}}\rho_i|b_i|}(i\in{{U}_{iT}})\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}
and $\gamma$ is
\begin{equation}\label{eq29}
  \gamma_1=\alpha;~~~\gamma_{2i}=1
\end{equation}
Clearly, we have
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq30}
&&\sum\limits_{i=1}^m\rho_ib_isign(b_i)\varrho^T\gamma\nonumber\\
&&=\sum\limits_{i=1}^m\rho_i|b_i|\Big(\frac{1}{\sum\limits_{i\in{\bar{U}_{iT}}}\rho_i|b_i|}\alpha+{\sum\limits_{i\in{U_{iT}}}}(-\frac{b_iu_{ki}}{\sum\limits_{i\in{\bar{U}_{iT}}}\rho_i|b_i|})\Big)\nonumber\\
&&=\sum\limits_{i\in\bar{U}_{iT}}\rho_i|b_i|\Big(\frac{1}{\sum\limits_{i\in{\bar{U}_{iT}}}\rho_i|b_i|}\alpha+{\sum\limits_{i\in{U_{iT}}}}(-\frac{b_iu_{ki}}{\sum\limits_{i\in{\bar{U}_{iT}}}\rho_i|b_i|})\Big)\nonumber\\
&&=\alpha-\sum\limits_{i\in U_T}b_iu_{ki}
\end{eqnarray}
With control law in (\ref{eq21})
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq31}
&&\sum\limits_{i=1}^mb_i(\rho_iu_{ci}+u_{ki})=\sum\limits_{i\in\bar U_{iT}}b_i\rho_iu_{ci}+\sum\limits_{i\in U_{iT}}b_iu_{ki}\nonumber\\
&&=\sum\limits_{i\in\bar U_{iT}}b_i\rho_isign(b_i)\hat\varrho^T\gamma+\sum\limits_{i\in U_{iT}}b_iu_{ki}\nonumber\\
&&=\sum\limits_{i\in\bar U_{iT}}b_i\rho_isign(b_i)(\tilde\varrho+\varrho)^T\gamma+\sum\limits_{i\in U_{iT}}b_iu_{ki}\nonumber\\
&&=\sum\limits_{i\in\bar U_{iT}}b_i\rho_isign(b_i)(\tilde\varrho+\varrho)^T\gamma+\sum\limits_{i\in U_{iT}}b_iu_{ki}
\end{eqnarray}
with (\ref{eq30}), we can get
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq32}
\sum\limits_{i=1}^mb_i(\rho_iu_{ci}+u_{ki})=\sum\limits_{i\in\bar U_{iT}}|b_i|\rho_i\tilde\varrho^T\gamma+\alpha
\end{eqnarray}
Then the derivative of $V_i$ can be rewritten as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq33}
\dot V_i&\leq&z_1z_2-k_1z_1^2+\frac{e_1}{2}h_2^2(t)+z_2(\sum\limits_{i\in\bar U_{iT}}|b_i|\rho_i\tilde\varrho^T\gamma+\alpha\nonumber\\
&&+\theta^Tf(x)+(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1})x_2)+\frac{z_2^2}{2 e_{22}}+(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1})\nonumber\\
&&\frac{z_2^2}{2 e_{21}}+\tilde\theta^T\Gamma_\theta^{-1}\dot{\hat\theta}+\sum\limits_{i\in \bar U_{it}}\rho_i|b_i|\tilde{\varrho}^T\Gamma_{\varrho}^{-1}\dot{\hat{\varrho}}\nonumber\\
&&+\frac{e_{21}}{2}(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1})h_1^2(t)+\frac{e_{22}}{2}h_2^2(t)\\
&=&-k_1z_1^2-k_2z_2^2+\sum\limits_{i\in \bar U_{it}}\rho_i|b_i|\tilde{\varrho}^T\Gamma_{\varrho}^{-1}(\dot{\hat{\varrho}}+\Gamma_\varrho\gamma z_2)\nonumber\\
&&+\tilde\theta^T\Gamma_\theta^{-1}(\dot{\hat\theta}-\Gamma_\theta f(x)z_2)+\frac{e_{22}}{2}h_2^2(t)\nonumber\\
&&+(\frac{e_1}{2}+\frac{e_{21}}{2}(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1}))h_1^2(t)\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
With update laws given in (\ref{eq23}), we can get
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq34}
\dot V_i&\leq&-k_1z_1^2-k_2z_2^2+\frac{e_{22}}{2}h_2^2(t)\nonumber\\
&&+(\frac{e_1}{2}+\frac{e_{21}}{2}(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1}))h_1^2(t)
\end{eqnarray}
%\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq34}
%\dot V_i&\leq&-k_1z_1^2-k_2z_2^2+\sum\limits_{i\in \bar U_{it}}\rho_i|b_i|\tilde{\varrho}^Tl_\varrho(\hat\varrho-\varrho_0)\nonumber\\
%&&+\tilde\theta^Tl_\theta(\hat\theta-\theta_0)+(\frac{e_1}{2}+\frac{e_{21}}{2}(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1}))h_1^2(t)\nonumber\\
%&&+\frac{e_{22}}{2}h_2^2(t)
%\end{eqnarray}
%Note that
%\begin{equation}\label{q35}
%l_\theta\tilde\theta^T(\hat\theta-\theta_0)\leq-\frac{1}{2}l_\theta||\tilde{\theta}||^2+\frac{1}{2}l_\theta||\theta-\theta_0||^2
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}\label{q36}
%l_\varrho\tilde\varrho^T(\hat\varrho-\varrho_0)\leq-\frac{1}{2}l_\varrho||\tilde{\varrho}||^2+\frac{1}{2}l_\varrho||\varrho-\varrho_0||^2
%\end{equation}
%We can obtain
%\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq37}
%\dot V_i&\leq&-\sum\limits_{i=1,2}k_iz_i^2-(\sum\limits_{i\in \bar U_{it}}\rho_i|b_i|)\frac{l_\varrho}{2}||\tilde{\varrho}||^2\nonumber\\
%&&-\frac{1}{2}l_\theta||\tilde{\theta}||^2+(\frac{e_1}{2}+\frac{e_{21}}{2}(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1}))h_1^2(t)\nonumber\\
%&&+\frac{e_{22}}{2}h_2^2(t)+\Pi_i
%\end{eqnarray}
%where
%\begin{equation}\label{eq38}
%\Pi_i=(\sum\limits_{i\in \bar U_{it}}\rho_i|b_i|)\frac{l_\varrho}{2}||\varrho-\varrho_0||^2+\frac{1}{2}l_\theta||\theta-\theta_0||^2
%\end{equation}
From Assumption 1, we have
%\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq39}
%\dot V_i&\leq&-\sum\limits_{i=1,2}k_iz_i^2-(\sum\limits_{i\in \bar U_{it}}\rho_i|b_i|)\frac{l_\varrho}{2}||\tilde{\varrho}||^2\nonumber\\
%&&-\frac{1}{2}l_\theta||\tilde{\theta}||^2+(\frac{e_1}{2}+\frac{e_{21}}{2}(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1}))\delta_1^2||x||_2^2\nonumber\\
%&&+\frac{e_{22}}{2}\delta_2^2||x||_2^2+\Pi_i
%\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq39}
\dot V_i&\leq&-\sum\limits_{i=1,2}k_iz_i^2+\frac{e_{22}}{2}\delta_2^2||x||_2^2\nonumber\\
&&+(\frac{e_1}{2}+\frac{e_{21}}{2}(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1}))\delta_1^2||x||_2^2
\end{eqnarray}
From coordinate changes (\ref{eq5}) and virtual controls (\ref{eq12}), we can get
\begin{equation}\label{eq40}
\left( {\begin{array}{cc}
  1 & 0 \\
  0 & 1
\end{array}}
\right)\left( {\begin{array}{c}
  x_1 \\
  x_2
\end{array}}
\right)=\left( {\begin{array}{cc}
  1 & 0\\
  -(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1}) & 1
\end{array}}
\right)\left( {\begin{array}{c}
  z_1 \\
  z_2
\end{array}}
\right)
\end{equation}
The following inequality can be obtained
\begin{equation}\label{eq41}
||x||_2\leq (2+(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1})^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}||z||_2
\end{equation}
So inequality (\ref{eq39}) can be rewritten as
%\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq42}
%\dot V_i&\leq&-\sum\limits_{i=1,2}k_iz_i^2-(\sum\limits_{i\in \bar U_{it}}\rho_i|b_i|)\frac{l_\varrho}{2}||\tilde{\varrho}||^2\nonumber\\
%&&-\frac{1}{2}l_\theta||\tilde{\theta}||^2+[(\frac{e_1}{2}+\frac{e_{21}}{2}(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1}))\delta_1^2+\frac{e_{22}}{2}\delta_2^2]\nonumber\\
%&&(2+(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1})^2)||z||_2^2+\Pi_i
%\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq42}
&&\dot V_i\leq-\sum\limits_{i=1,2}k_iz_i^2+(2+(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1})^2)\\
&&[(\frac{e_1}{2}+\frac{e_{21}}{2}(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1}))\delta_1^2+\frac{e_{22}}{2}\delta_2^2]||z||_2^2\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
In order to stabilize the system, the following requirement on design parameters can be established
\begin{equation}\label{eq43}
\left\{ {\begin{array}{cc}
  k_1\geq [(\frac{e_1}{2}+\frac{e_{21}}{2}(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1}))\delta_1^2+\frac{e_{22}}{2}\delta_2^2](2+(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1})^2) \\ \\
  k_2\geq [(\frac{e_1}{2}+\frac{e_{21}}{2}(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1}))\delta_1^2+\frac{e_{22}}{2}\delta_2^2](2+(k_1+\frac{1}{2e_1})^2)
\end{array}}
\right.
\end{equation}
Clearly, the second inequality is easy to be realized by choosing $k_2$ big enough. So the key lies in how to select $k_2$ such that the first inequality.
We now discuss the existence of a positive constant $\delta^*$ such that for all $\delta_i<\delta^*$ design parameters $k_1$ can be chosen to make the first inequality hold. For a group of design parameters $k_1^*, e_1^*, e_{21}^*, e_{22}^*$, clearly there exists a $\delta^*$ making
\begin{equation}\label{eq44}
\Phi^*=[(\frac{e_1^*}{2}+\frac{e_{21^*}}{2}(k_1^*+\frac{1}{2e_1^*}))(\delta^*)^2+\frac{e_{22}^*}{2}(\delta^*)^2](2+(k_1^*+\frac{1}{2e_1^*})^2)
\end{equation}
small enough and then satisfying
\begin{equation}\label{eq45}
k_1^*>\Phi^*
\end{equation}
So for all $\delta_i<\delta^*$, we have
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq46}
&&[(\frac{e_1^*}{2}+\frac{e_{21^*}}{2}(k_1^*+\frac{1}{2e_1^*}))(\delta_1)^2+\frac{e_{22}^*}{2}(\delta_2)^2]\nonumber\\
&&(2+(k_1^*+\frac{1}{2e_1^*})^2)\leq\Phi^*<k_1^*
\end{eqnarray}
Namely, for above $\delta^*$ when $\delta_i<\delta^*$ design parameters $k_1^*, e_1^*, e_{21}^*, e_{22}^*$ can make the first inequality of (\ref{eq43}) hold. Letting
\begin{equation}\label{eq47}
k^*\triangleq k_2^*=k_1^*
\end{equation}
we can get
%\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq48}
%\dot V_i\leq-\ell\sum\limits_{i=1}^2z_i^2-(\sum\limits_{i\in \bar U_{it}}\rho_i|b_i|)\frac{l_\varrho}{2}||\tilde{\varrho}||^2-\frac{1}{2}l_\theta||\tilde{\theta}||^2+\Pi_i
%\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq48}
\dot V_i\leq-\ell\sum\limits_{i=1}^2z_i^2
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{equation}\label{eq49}
\ell=k^*-\Phi^*>0
\end{equation}
%Similar to [5] and [6], letting
%\begin{equation}\label{eq50}
%\chi=(z_1, z_2, \tilde\theta^T, \tilde\varrho^T)
%\end{equation}
%We can get
%\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq51}
%\dot V_i\leq-\hbar_1||\chi||_2^2+\Pi_i
%\end{eqnarray}
%where
%\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq52}
%\hbar_1=min\{\ell, \frac{l_\varrho}{2}\sum\limits_{i\in \bar U_{it}}\rho_i|b_i|, \frac{1}{2}l_\theta\}
%\end{eqnarray}

 From (\ref{eq48}), we know $V_i$ is non increasing in time interval $[T_i, T_{i+1})$. So we can get $V_j(T_{i+1}^-)\leq{V_i(T_i^+)}$. When $i=0$, it is $V_0(T_{1}^-)\leq{V_0(0)}$. It can be conclude that all signals $z_i$, $\tilde{\theta}$, $\tilde{\varrho}$ are bounded in the time interval $[0,T_1)$. Noting that the difference between $V_1(T_1^+)$ and $V_0(T_1^-)$ is only the coefficients in front of the term $\tilde\varrho^T\Gamma_\varrho\tilde\varrho$. Since all the possible jumping on $\varrho$ are bounded, $V_1(T_1^+)$ is bounded, then $V_1(T_2^-)$ is bounded. Similar to the above analysis, we can get $V_i(T_{i+1}^-)$ is bounded from the bound of $V_i(T_i^+)$ and $V_{i-1}(T_i^-)$. Also we can get $V_f(T_f^+)$ is bounded by the bound of $V_{f-1}(T_f^-)$ and $V_{f-1}(T_{f-1}^+)$. Therefore, $V_f$ is non increasing in time interval $(T_f,\infty)$. Namely, it can be shown that $V_f(t)\leq V_f(T_f^+)$. Then we can get $z,\tilde{\theta},\tilde{\varrho}$ are all bounded in $[0,\infty]$. Easily, we can get $lim_{t\rightarrow{\infty}}|y|=0$ from (\ref{eq48}).

  \item In order to prove the derivative of $V_i$ being non-positive in time interval $[T_i, T_{i+1})$, linear transformation between vector $x$ and $z$ is established in the controller design. Such analysis is quite different from standard backstepping procedures.
  \item The value of parameter $\delta^*$ is difficult to obtain for a general uncertain nonlinear system, especially for high order nonlinear systems. If so, the significance of our results is to show the existence of such a parameter. Namely, when magnitude $\delta_i$ of time delay term $h_i(\cdot)$ satisfying the condition that $\delta_i<\delta^*$, the controller shown in this paper can stabilize system (\ref{eq1}).

\section{Simulation Studies}
In this section, the results of simulation are presented  to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed robust adaptive neural network tracking control law for uncertain missile systems with hysteresis input. In the simulation,
following parameters of the missile system are chosen: the mass of missile $m=204kg$, dynamic pressure $Q=29938kg/m^2$, characteristic area $S=0.041m^2$, characteristic length $d=0.23m$, moment of inertia $I=247.4kg\cdot m^2$, mach number $M_{nb}=2.5$ and velocity $v=340m/s$. Unknown parameters in aerodynamic force model are given as $a_n=0.000103, b_n=0.00945, c_n=0.1619, d_n=0.034, a_m=0.000215, b_m=-0.0195, c_m=0.051, d_m=0.206$.

\section{Conclusion}
A robust adaptive neural network state feedback control scheme is proposed by using
backstepping technique for missile systems with unknown parameters and unknown
hysteresis input. An approximator is designed based on neural networks to compensate for the uncertainties
caused by unknown hysteresis. The boundedness of all signals of the closed-loop system and tracking performance are
ensured by the proposed control law and corresponding update laws. Simulation studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
